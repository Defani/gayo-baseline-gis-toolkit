## Overview

This plugin consolidates the recurring, otherwise manual steps of a field-based baseline GIS assessment into one QGIS sidebar panel, mapped to the stages a GIS consultant normally works through on this kind of survey:

| Workflow stage | What a GIS consultant would otherwise do manually | Toolkit feature(s) covering it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Field data ingestion | Manually export KoboToolbox submissions, geocode them, rebuild geometry from geopoint/geotrace strings | Kobo Connect |
| 2. Field evidence handling | Manually download attachment URLs one by one, resize/rotate images, link them back to the right feature | Foto di Layer, Foto Explorer |
| 3. Data QA/QC | Write ad hoc QGIS expressions to find missing coordinates, duplicates or incomplete records | Quick Query |
| 4. Base data preparation | Separately add web basemaps, WMTS/WMS/WFS services, local reference files, or set up the Earth Engine Python API and write scripts to pull imagery | Add Layer, Basemap Search (QMS), GEE Connect |
| 5. Spatial analysis | Build a spatial index, reproject to a local UTM zone, and script a nearest-neighbor distance calculation by hand | Distance Analysis |
| 6. Data delivery / integration | Export layers individually to the format each stakeholder needs, or manually run `ogr2ogr`/write SQL to push data into PostGIS | Export Data, Export to Database |
| 7. Field logistics | Manually convert layers to GPX for GPS units | Export to GPX |
| 8. Cartographic output | Manually compute grid cells and index labels for a multi-page map series/atlas | Grid Index |

In short: it is not a single-purpose tool, but a packaged set of the repetitive KoboToolbox-to-QGIS-to-deliverable steps a GIS consultant would otherwise re-implement per project, built specifically for the Gayo coffee farmer baseline survey (Konsorsium Konservasi Kopi Gayo) in Aceh Tengah and Bener Meriah, Aceh. Every tool is exposed as a `QWidget` page inside a single `QDockWidget` (see [System architecture](FEATURES.md#0-system-architecture) for the full technical breakdown), and the Grid Index step is also registered as a standalone `QgsProcessingAlgorithm` so it can be scripted or batch-run from the Processing Toolbox instead of the panel.

## Features

All 12 tools live in one dockable sidebar panel (toolbar icon or Plugins menu) - pick a tool from the list, it opens in place, and "Back to menu" returns to the list. The table below explains, for each tool, **why it exists in the survey workflow**, **exactly what it does step by step**, and what you get out of it, with links to the relevant QGIS documentation and the file format/standard involved.

| # | Feature | Function in the toolkit (why it exists) | How it works (step by step) | Output | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Kobo Connect** | Brings field survey data collected in KoboToolbox into QGIS, so the baseline survey can be mapped and analyzed spatially instead of staying as raw form data | Log in with the KoboToolbox API URL, username and password -> list the user's forms -> pick a form and its geometry field -> the plugin authenticates and downloads every submission (paginated) -> flattens nested/repeat-group answers and parses the geometry -> builds a feature collection and loads it as a QGIS layer | A QGIS vector layer with one feature per submission, all survey answers as attributes | [Creating vector layers](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/create_layer.html) - [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) - [KoboToolbox API](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/api.html) |
| 2 | **Foto di Layer (Kobo)** | Lets field photos taken during the survey be seen directly on the map next to the point that was surveyed, instead of digging through a folder of image files | Pick the survey layer and its photo field(s) -> the plugin detects which fields hold photo attachments and which field is the ID/title -> choose a download folder -> it downloads each photo from Kobo (authenticated), resizes it and fixes its EXIF rotation, then saves it under a predictable filename -> adds a virtual "path" field pointing to the saved file -> builds a map tip and configures the attribute form to preview the photo | Photos saved locally, a new path field on the layer, and a photo preview when hovering a point (map tip) or opening its attribute form | [Map tips](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/general_tools.html#identify-features-with-map-tips) - [Photo/editing widgets](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html#fields-properties) - [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) |
| 3 | **Foto Explorer (Kobo)** | Gives a quick way to browse and quality-check all the photos attached to repeated question groups in a Kobo form (e.g. multiple tree photos per plot), without opening each submission one by one | Connect to the Kobo form -> the plugin detects image fields inside repeat groups -> fetches submissions and builds one browsable entry per photo -> pick a photo in the list to download it on demand and preview it full-size | An in-panel photo browser/preview for every photo in a repeat group, without pre-downloading everything | [Attribute table](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/attribute_table.html) - [KoboToolbox](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/) |
| 4 | **Quick Query** | Speeds up day-to-day data checking: finding a specific respondent, filtering by a field value, or spotting bad/incomplete records, without writing a QGIS expression by hand every time | Pick the layer -> use the search box (text/attribute search), the filter box (field + operator + value), or a ready-made QC preset (e.g. "empty geometry / no coordinates") -> the plugin builds the matching QGIS expression and applies it as a layer filter or selection | A filtered attribute table / map view showing only the matching or flagged features | [Expressions](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/expressions/expression.html) - [Selecting features](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_selection.html) |
| 5 | **Distance Analysis** | Answers the baseline assessment's core spatial question - how far is each surveyed coffee farm from a forest area, and what is that forest area's legal/conservation status - which is needed to flag encroachment risk | Pick the survey point layer and the forest/kawasan polygon layer plus its status field -> the plugin builds a spatial index of the forest polygons and picks a local UTM zone for accurate metric distances -> for every point it finds the nearest forest polygon, the distance to it, and its status field value -> converts the distance to m/km -> either draws a line from each point to its nearest forest (for visual QC) or writes the distance/status straight into new columns on the point layer | New distance + forest-status columns on the point layer, and/or a line layer showing each point-to-forest connection, plus a summary of the results | [Vector analysis (Processing)](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectoranalysis.html) - [Spatial index](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/vector.html#using-spatial-index) - [Nearest neighbor search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search) - [UTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system) |
| 6 | **Export Data** | Hands survey results to people or tools that don't use QGIS - program officers reviewing data in Excel, or another system that consumes GeoJSON/CSV | Pick the layer and a target format (Excel, GeoJSON or CSV) and an output path -> the plugin writes the layer through QGIS's own vector writer (GDAL/OGR underneath), fixing the file extension if needed | A single Excel/GeoJSON/CSV file with the layer's geometry and attributes | [Saving vector layers](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/create_layer.html#saving-vector-layers) - [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) - [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) - [XLSX/Office Open XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) |
| 7 | **Export to Database** | Moves survey data into a proper spatial database so it can be queried, shared with a team, or connected to other GIS/web tools instead of living only as local files | Pick a saved PostGIS connection (or a Supabase Postgres connection set up the same way) and a destination table name -> the plugin sanitizes the layer and its field names into safe SQL identifiers -> exports the layer via QGIS's native database exporter, no extra database driver needed | A new (or appended) spatial table inside the PostGIS/Supabase database | [Opening a database (PostGIS)](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/opening_data.html#opening-a-database) - [PostGIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostGIS) - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs) |
| 8 | **Add Layer** | One place to bring in every kind of base data the survey needs - basemap tiles, official web map services, local files handed over by partners, or Earth Engine imagery - without hunting through QGIS's several different "Add Layer" menus | Pick a source tab: for web tiles, enter an XYZ/WMTS/WMS/WFS URL (the plugin can read the service's capabilities to fill in the details automatically); for files, browse to any format QGIS/GDAL can read; for Earth Engine, pick a dataset (handled by GEE Connect, tool 10) -> the plugin builds the matching QGIS data source and adds it to the map | A new raster or vector layer on the map canvas, from whichever source was picked | [Loading data (Add data)](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/opening_data.html) - [Working with OGC data](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/index.html) - [WMTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Tile_Service) - [WMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service) - [WFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service) - [XYZ tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map) |
| 9 | **Basemap Search (QMS)** | Gives a fast way to add a familiar basemap (OSM, Google, Bing, Esri, USGS, Yandex, etc.) for visual context, without opening QGIS's separate Web > QuickMapServices menu | Type a search term -> the plugin searches the basemap catalog bundled with the separately-installed QuickMapServices plugin -> pick a result -> it is added straight to the map using QuickMapServices' own "add to map" helper | A basemap raster tile layer added to the project | [XYZ tile connections](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/ogc_client_support.html#xyz-tile-connections) - [QuickMapServices plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/quick_map_services/) |
| 10 | **GEE Connect** | Brings satellite imagery and other Earth Engine datasets (e.g. land cover, deforestation alerts, elevation) into the survey area, without leaving QGIS to use the Earth Engine Code Editor | Checks the Google Earth Engine Python API is installed and authenticated -> browse/search a trimmed Earth Engine dataset catalog -> pick a dataset, a date range and an area of interest -> the plugin builds the corresponding Earth Engine image (applying date/region/visualization filters) and asks Earth Engine for an XYZ tile URL (or, for vector datasets, downloads the features as GeoJSON) -> adds the result as a layer | A raster layer streamed live from Earth Engine's servers (or a vector layer for feature datasets) | [Raster layers](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/raster_properties.html) - [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) - [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) - [geemap](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap) (catalog trimmed from geemap; see citation below) |
| 11 | **Export to GPX** | Turns survey points/lines into a track/waypoint file that can be loaded onto a handheld Garmin GPS for offline field navigation, where QGIS itself isn't available | Pick the point or line layer and a field to use as each point's name (or leave it blank to dissolve everything into one named track) -> the plugin runs it through QGIS's native Processing algorithms to fix geometries, convert polygons to lines if needed, dissolve/split features and set the name field -> writes the result using GDAL's GPX driver | A `.gpx` file with waypoints/tracks ready to copy onto a Garmin device | [Working with GPS data](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_gps/index.html) - [GPX (GPS Exchange Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) |
| 12 | **Grid Index** | Produces the index grid needed to print or export the survey area as a multi-page map series/atlas (a common requirement for field teams and reports), instead of working with one unmanageably large map | Set the area extent, map scale, page size and rotation -> the plugin's Processing algorithm checks whether the layer's CRS is projected or geographic (transforming to World Mercator EPSG:3395 first if geographic, so cell sizes stay accurate) -> computes grid cells covering the extent at the chosen scale/page size and labels each one | A polygon grid layer, each cell labeled as one atlas page, ready to drive a QGIS Print Layout atlas | [Coordinate reference systems](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_projections/index.html) - [Atlas generation](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_output.html#atlas-generation) - [Map series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_series) - [World Mercator (EPSG:3395)](https://epsg.io/3395) |
